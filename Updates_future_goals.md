# Update


## What does our project do?

+ Our “Park My Bike” application recommends the safest bike parking spots for our users based on crimes committed near the bike parking racks over the last three years.

+ Bike parking safety scores are available for two cities, Chicago and San Francisco.

+ The crimes which were accounted for are larceny, robbery and vehicle theft.

+ For Chicago, scores are available for bike parking racks with at least five parking spaces.

+ For San Francisco, scores are available for bike parking racks with at least three parking spaces.

+ An application interface allows users to access the bike parking information and safety scores.

+ Users in Chicago and San Francisco simply enter their current location and five nearby bike locations are returned to them. 

+ In addition to the location name, the address, the distance and the safety scores are also returned.


## What are our future goals?

+ Provide actual GPS directions for users to get to the recommended bike parking locations.

+ Allow users to give us feedback on how reliable they judged our recommendations to be.

+ Extend this project to more cities, such as Boston and New York where cycling is a popular activity.

+ Allow users to report bike thefts. We would then update safety scores based on these new reports.

+ Extend the safety application to car parking.
