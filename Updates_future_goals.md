What does our project do?

Our “Park My Bike” application seeks to recommend the safest bike parking sports for our users based on crimes committed in their vicinity over the last three years.
Bike parking safety scores were calculated for two cities, Chicago and San Francisco.
The crimes we focused on are theft, robbery and vehicle theft.
For Chicago, scores were calculated for bike parking racks with at least five parking spaces.
For San Francisco, scores were calculated for bike parking racks with at least three parking spaces.
An application interface was created to access the bike parking data and safety scores.
Users in Chicago and San Francisco simply enter their current location and five nearby bike locations are returned to them. 
In addition to the location name, the address, the distance and the safety scores are also returned.

What are our future goals?

Provide directions on how users can get to the recommended bike parking locations from their current locations.
Enable user feedback on how reliable they judged our recommendations to be.
Extend this project to more cities, especially in cities such as Boston and New York where cycling is a popular activity.
Enable user-reported bike thefts and update safety scores based on these new reports.
Extend the safety application to car parking.
